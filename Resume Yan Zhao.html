		<p>Taking this course is like picking up a new game from JB hi fi. It is both exciting and dounting. There is no doubt that learning 3 laugages in 10 weeks is a challenging task. Just like when I started my first Street Fighter game--a lot of butts will be kicked, and it will take quite a long time before I can figure out the moves and buttons.</p>
        
        <p>But that is also where the fun starts! There's more opportunity to improve myself everyday; learning new things brings new aspects to my otherwise routined life; and I can meet more people besides my normal social cricle. So eventually, I believe I will have the strenth and perseverance to level up and become the dual shotgun weilding, shapeshifting, and spell casting wizard of the Internet.</p>
